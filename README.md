Greetings, I'm Michael Burry, and I'm here to ignite your financial savviness and steer you towards wise investment choices.

To run the refactored code on your local system, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt. Make sure you have the requirements.txt file in the same directory as your Python file.
Update the bot_token, bot_user_name, and webhook_url variables in your code with your own bot's credentials and webhook URL.
Start a local server that can receive incoming requests from Telegram. You can use tools like ngrok or localtunnel for this. For example, if you're using ngrok, you can run the command ngrok http 8443 in a separate terminal window.
Copy the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok or localtunnel and set it as the webhook_url variable in your code.
Start the bot by running your Python script.
Note: Make sure to set the listen parameter in updater.start_webhook() to 0.0.0.0 to make the server accessible from outside your local system. If you're using ngrok or localtunnel, the URL generated by these tools should be used as the webhook_url.

If everything is set up correctly, your bot should now be able to receive messages from Telegram and respond to them.
